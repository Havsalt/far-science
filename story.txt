Doing science before virus
- Frozen in cryo to make virus sleep
- Virus is waking up, the warmer it gets (have "quest" at the start from AI to turn on heat)
?Had more crewmembers?
(Not yet) Space station requires maintainance
       -> Perhaps single repair quest? *Fetch and apply quest*
The AI supercomputer demands work before giving clues
- Have initial encounter (heater quest)

Was making a super plant growing serum
- Gone wrong

"When i stared into the space, I saw how the black hole merged with those planets,
Perhaps that is what it takes?"
- Put sprout in human (ME), fine at first...

About SPROUT BACTERIA
- Like a virus
- Injected into ME, for containment?
- Because of Doloris, somehow?
- Frozen inside of ME, to stop it from growing - turing it dormant
